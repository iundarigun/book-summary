# 3. Getting the title where you are

> Reaching Staff is a combination of luck, timing, and work, and  timing is a particular sort of luck

Senior engineer is the career level at most companies. They have no expectation that you'll ever go from Senior to Staff. Furthermore, companies' promotion systens will often impede your further progress once you attain the career level.

> The strongest source of friction is that the nature of the job changes. A Staff engineer isn't a better Senior engineer, but someone who’s moved into fulfilling one of the Staff archetypes.

If pursuing that sort of role is your goal, you will have to take deliberate control of your progession.

## Finding your trail
The transition to a self-directed career can feel rather abrupt. Some help:
- Promotion packet: Prioritize the right personal development to ensure you get there
- Staff Project: Most Staff engineers do not have a Staff project, but also some companies require to promote you
- Get into the room (and stay): A frequent complaint from engineers is that they’re not “in the room” where decisions happen, and they’re usually right: You're probably not in the room for a good reason.
- Become visible: You won't get promoted if your company's leadership doesn't know who you are.

### Opportunity is unequally distributed
For example, if your company leadership views infrastructure engineering as inherently “more complex” or “more leveraged” than product engineering, then opportunity will consolidate within infrastructure teams.

> Many companies believe they have a vested interest in pretending opportunity is evenly distributed, even when it clearly isn’t.

you have to assess how fixable they are and where you want to prioritize your energy

### Should you try management?

Most folks who reach Staff-plus roles do not spend time in engineering management, but some do.

> If you want to give management a try, you should. Most companies understand that management isn't the right role for everyone and will be glad to let you rotate back into an engineering role

Those that try management gain a broader perspective that helps them even when they move back into a software engineering role.

“Manager career path vs engineering career path” is a false dichotomy, and taking time to alternate between both roles can makes you better at both.

> if you take it on with the wrong motivations, you’ll regret the experience, but not nearly as much as your team will. If you’re motivated to help your team grow and succeed, then go ahead and do it; if you’re only doing it for yourself, then don’t.

### A semi-permeable boundary
Staff-plus titles are leadership positions. It’s uniquely challenging to gain a leadership position if the existing leadership team doesn’t identify with you as a potential member.

Also, you can face other challenges, like structural disadvantage: half the women had to change companies to attain the Staff title, whereas promotion friction come up less frequently during discussions with men.

## Promotion packets
Start to write your first Staff promotion packet long before you think you're likely to be promoted to Staff

A general template format:
- What did you do? Keep it very short and then link out to supporting design documents
- What are the high-leverage ways you’ve improved the organization?
- What is the quantifiable impact of your projects?
- Who have you mentored and through what accomplishments?
- What glue work do you do for the organization?
- Which teams and leaders are familiar with and advocates for your work?
- Do you have a real or perceived skill or behavior gaps that might hold you back? For each, how would you address the concern?


It’s useful to spend some time to write out those answers yourself, but getting promoted into a leadership role isn’t a solo activity. Keep in mind:

1. Answer why you’re doing this. Many folks choose not to pursue the Staff level; You should have a reason why this is important to you.
2. Temper your expectations. Promotions, especially at this level, are built over quarters, halves, and years.
3. Bring your manager into the fold. Bring the promotion packet to your next 1:1 with your manager, and tell them that attaining a Staff promotion is a goal of yours. Ask them what’s missing, what to emphasize, and if they’d recommend adding steps to the workflow.
4. Write the promotion packet: throw all your ideas together in a first version.
5. Edit the promotion packet. Wait two days, reread your promotion packet and edit for content, clarity, and context
6. Edit the promotion packet with peers. Share your promotion packet with several trusted peers to get feedback, preferably peers already in a Staff-plus role.
7. Edit the promotion packet with your manager. Share your promotion packet with your manager and request feedback. Ask for a particular focus on enumerating gaps to address.
8. Periodically review the promotion packet with your manager. Both you and your manager should use it to steer you towards demonstrating the promotion criteria over time. This is particularly important to do if your direct manager changes

It will consolidate your energy on the development and work that’ll move you towards your goal.

### Find your sponsor

> A Staff engineer isn't just a faster Senior engineer

Some folks are often frustrated by the distance between their impact and their recognized impact and ask their managers and peers for feedback on closing that gap.

Sometimes, performance evaluation seems falsely as a solo activity, but promotions are a team activity.

- The first step of activating your sponsors is explicitly sharing your goals: __“I’m looking to be recognized as a Staff engineer”__
- The next one can be asking your sponsor how you can support their sponsorship. Owning your career isn’t only about asking for things. It __is__ about that, but it’s much more about facilitating those things happening.
- Reviewing your promotion packet collaboratively with your sponsors
- Activating your sponsor isn’t a transactional thing to do once before your promotion. They always need folks to join a working group, volunteer and put in the work

### What if it doesn’t work?

Your manager has too direct an influence on your impact and your perceived impact. 
You’ll cheat yourself if you immediately try to switch teams or companies after running into friction with your manager. Companies generally don’t allow transfers unless your manager approves it, and  you’ll lose the opportunity to develop your skill of working with folks you don’t immediately click with 

> it’s not a fun skill to develop, but leadership __always__ involves influencing and building relationships with those with conflicting goals and styles.

Nevertheless, if you’ve spent six months proactively trying to make the relationship work, then it probably is time to explore moving teams. This is one of many cases where it’s extremely helpful to have developed your relationship with your skip-level manager, who can help you find a new team.

## Staff projects

There isn’t an explicit expectation, but it is understood that you’ll complete a Staff Project to get promoted.

`Staff project` is a project that is considered complex and important enough that the person who completes it has proven themselves as a Staff engineer. It’s important to pierce the mythology of these projects

Even, most engineers don’t complete one as part of reaching a Staff role. We can explore three angles:
1. Folks who didn’t complete Staff projects
2. Folks who did complete Staff projects, including where they don’t end up working as planned
3. Identifying and approaching your Staff project

As mentioned, it’s true that many companies require, or informally enforce, Staff projects for internal promotions, and consequently, many folks do take on a Staff project as part of their role transition.

### Why you should do a Staff project

Although you can attain a Staff-plus role without completing a Staff project, they’re a particularly valuable opportunity to develop yourself as an engineer.

There are a few typical characteristics that capture why they’re so effective at stretching you as an engineer:
- **Complex and ambiguous** - early in your career, you’re given well-defined problems. Staff projects will generally start with a poorly scoped but complex and important problem. You’ll have to identify a concrete approach that works.
- **Numerous and divided stakeholders** - the easiest projects start with organizational alignment around both the problem and the solution, but your Staff project might likely start with neither.
- **Named bet where failure matters** - Project important enough for folks will be watching your work closely, and any failures will be very visible. Success will be highly visible, as well!

> These can be pretty nerve-wracking, which is also why they’re so effective at developing you.

### Getting access to Staff projects
You still need to get access to these projects, which depends on your management chain trusting you enough. Three factors:
1. Learn to stay aligned with your leadership team
2. You need to be known to have the technical aptitude for the problem at hand
3. Your company having a pressing need to solve a Staff-level problem.

### Should you pursue a Staff project?
If you’re looking to get promoted within your current company and haven’t previously held a Staff or management title before, then you’ll likely need to pursue a Staff project to establish yourself at that level.

> Keep in mind that they are also  some of the most challenging work you can find and are the sort of work that will stretch and develop you into a better engineer.

## Get in the room, and stay there
Staff-plus engineers frequently cite access to “the room” as a major benefit of their level. However, it’s important to remember there’s no single “room” to enter: It might be a sprint pre-planning meeting with your tech lead and product manager. Later it might be a quarterly planning meeting, an architecture review, the performance calibration, the engineering leadership team. 

There will always be another room to enter: you have to become effective at not only entering but also staying in these rooms of power.

### Getting in the room

To get into the room, you need:
- **To bring something useful to the room...** This could be details on a critical project or  experience running a similar project or team at a previous company.
- **...that the room doesn’t already have**. It’s not enough to have something useful to bring to the room. It also needs to be a perspective that isn’t already present within the room. To be included in those rooms, you’ll need to bring something distinct from the current membership.
- **A sponsor in the roonm**: You’ll need someone to sponsor your membership. Your sponsor is allocating their social capital towards your inclusion
- **Your sponsor needs to know you want to be there.** They won’t necessarily assume you want to be in any particular meeting

Some of the approaches that work well to increase your value to the room:
- **Stay aligned with your manager**. Folks evaluate leaders on how aligned their teams are with their announced approach. If you’re __particularly__ aligned, they’re more likely to yield their own seat to you and stop attending.
- **Optimize for the group**. Trust and confidence in your judgment.
- **Speak clearly and concisely**. As you develop an economy of speech, you’ll be able to contribute more ideas with less time. If folks don’t understand your proposal, then it doesn’t matter how good it is.
- **Be low friction**. Those sorts of discussions usually spend their time draining frustration rather than making forward progress. If you’re known as someone who can navigate difficult conversations effectively, you’re much more likely to be involved.
- **Come prepared**. Take the time to organize your thoughts before each meeting. Equally important is following up on what you committed to.
- **Focus and be present**. Be sure to show up the engage. Be attentive and engaged
- **Volunteer for low-status tasks**

### Staying in the room
Getting into the room is your first hurdle, but the second hurdle is staying in the room: keep doing the things that got you into the room.
Some things that can get you kicked out of the room:
- **Misunderstanding the room’s purpose.** Take the time to understand how the room operates and integrate into it with respect for that intention.
- **Being dogmatic**. If you’re dogmatic, you will create friction that slows down discussions and progress.
- **Withholding consent**
- **Sucking the oxygen out of the room.** There are brainstorm discussions where every idea is welcome, and there are moments when you’ve shifted into operating mode to unblock project execution, and you have to read the room on which is happening.
- **Embarrassing your sponsor**. Remember that you got into a room because someone in the room advocated for your inclusion.
- **Being flakey or not showing up regularly.** There are only so many slots, and the person running the meeting will prioritize them on people who show up.

### Exiting the room
There are infinite rooms to be in, there’s no room where the work actually happens. You’ll be most impactful if you’re selective on which rooms you stay in.

## Being visible

One of the most effective ways to get __luckier__ is to be more visible within your organization. Your goal is to be known for good things

### Why visibility matters


Staff-plus roles are leadership roles, the company is bringing you into its leadership team. But they can't believe in you if they don't know you

> Less inclusive organizations inadvertently center access on folks who most aggressively self-advertise.

### Internal visibility

The single best way to create internal visibility is to work on the things that matter to your company and company leadership. 

Some strategies are:
- Write and distribute more long-lived documents
- Lead company forums like architecture reviews, company all hands, and learning circles
- Be a cheerleader for your team’s and peers’ work on Slack and email
- Share weekly notes of your work to your team and stakeholders
- Contribute to your company’s blog
- Attend, or potentially even host, office hours for your team or org

Find the right mix of activities that leverage your strengths

### Executive visibility

To be promoted to a leadership role, the most important kind of internal visibility is executive visibility. Using the promotion packet, you will create visibility with your manager, but it’s helpful to go further.

These are the folks who tend to be in the room that approves promotions into Staff-plus roles, and they rarely support folks whose work they don’t know.

### External visibility

Many find external visibility contributes to their career. One advantage of building an external presence is that there’s a lot more room to create a niche and name for yourself. It could be giving a conference talk, going on a podcast, or turning a problem into a website and book

### Should you focus on visibility?

My advice would be to use the promotion packet exercise to identify if the lack of visibility is likely to hold you back in the promotion process.

 Visibility is a transient currency. Learning and developing yourself is a permanent one.
