# 3. Getting the title where you are

> Reaching Staff is a combination of luck, timing, and work

Senior engineer is the career level at most companies. They have no expectation that you'll ever go from Senior to Staff. Furthermore, companies' promotion systens will often impede your further progress once you attain the career level.

> The strongest source of friction is that the nature of the job changes. A Staff engineer isn't a better Senior engineer, but someone who’s moved into fulfilling one of the Staff archetypes.

If pursuing that sort of role is your goal, you will have to take deliberate control of your progession.

## Finding your trail
The transition to a self-directed career can feel rather abrupt. Some help:
- Promotion packet: Prioritize the right personal development to ensure you get there
- Staff Project: Most Staff engineers do not have a Staff project, but also some companies require to promote you
- Get into the room (and stay): A frequent complaint from engineers is that they’re not “in the room” where decisions happen, and they’re usually right: You're probably not in the room for a good reason.
- Become visible: You won't get promoted if your company's leadership doesn't know who you are.

### Opportunity is unequally distributed
For example, if your company leadership views infrastructure engineering as inherently “more complex” or “more leveraged” than product engineering, then opportunity will consolidate within infrastructure teams.

> Many companies believe they have a vested interest in pretending opportunity is evenly distributed, even when it clearly isn’t.

you have to assess how fixable they are and where you want to prioritize your energy

### Should you try management?

Most folks who reach Staff-plus roles do not spend time in engineering management, but some do.

> If you want to give management a try, you should. Most companies understand that management isn't the right role for everyone and will be glad to let you rotate back into an engineering role

Those that try management gain a broader perspective that helps them even when they move back into a software engineering role.

“Manager career path vs engineering career path” is a false dichotomy, and taking time to alternate between both roles can makes you better at both.

> if you take it on with the wrong motivations, you’ll regret the experience, but not nearly as much as your team will. If you’re motivated to help your team grow and succeed, then go ahead and do it; if you’re only doing it for yourself, then don’t.

### A semi-permeable boundary
Staff-plus titles are leadership positions. It’s uniquely challenging to gain a leadership position if the existing leadership team doesn’t identify with you as a potential member.

Also, you can face other challenges, like structural disadvantage: half the women had to change companies to attain the Staff title, whereas promotion friction come up less frequently during discussions with men.

## Promotion packets
Start to write your first Staff promotion packet long before you think you're likely to be promoted to Staff

A general template format:
- What did you do? Keep it very short and then link out to supporting design documents
- What are the high-leverage ways you’ve improved the organization?
- What is the quantifiable impact of your projects?
- Who have you mentored and through what accomplishments?
- What glue work do you do for the organization?
- Which teams and leaders are familiar with and advocates for your work?
- Do you have a real or perceived skill or behavior gaps that might hold you back? For each, how would you address the concern?


It’s useful to spend some time to write out those answers yourself, but getting promoted into a leadership role isn’t a solo activity. Keep in mind:

1. Answer why you’re doing this. Many folks choose not to pursue the Staff level; You should have a reason why this is important to you.
2. Temper your expectations. Promotions, especially at this level, are built over quarters, halves, and years.
3. Bring your manager into the fold. Bring the promotion packet to your next 1:1 with your manager, and tell them that attaining a Staff promotion is a goal of yours. Ask them what’s missing, what to emphasize, and if they’d recommend adding steps to the workflow.
4. Write the promotion packet: throw all your ideas together in a first version.
5. Edit the promotion packet. Wait two days, reread your promotion packet and edit for content, clarity, and context
6. Edit the promotion packet with peers. Share your promotion packet with several trusted peers to get feedback, preferably peers already in a Staff-plus role.
7. Edit the promotion packet with your manager. Share your promotion packet with your manager and request feedback. Ask for a particular focus on enumerating gaps to address.
8. Periodically review the promotion packet with your manager. Both you and your manager should use it to steer you towards demonstrating the promotion criteria over time. This is particularly important to do if your direct manager changes
