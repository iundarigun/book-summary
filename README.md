# Designing Data-intensive applications

An application is data-intensive if data is its primary challenge — the quantity of data, the complexity of data, or the speed at which it is changing — as opposed to compute-intensive , where CPU cycles are the bottleneck.

As software engineers, we need to have a technically accurate and precise understanding of the various technologies and their trade-offs if we want to build good applications. Not just how they work, but also why they work that way, and what questions we need to ask.

Behind the rapid changes in technology, there are enduring principles that remain true, no matter which version of a particular tool you are using.

Building for scale that you don’t need is wasted effort and may lock you into an inflexible design. It is a form of premature optimization. However, it’s also important to choose the right tool for the job.
